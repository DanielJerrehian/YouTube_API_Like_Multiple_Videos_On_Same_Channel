# YouTube_API_Like__Multiple_Videos_On_Same_Channel
Python script using the YouTube API to give the "X" most recent videos a 'thumbs up' rating

The intention of this script was to quickly provide a "like" rating across all videos on a YouTube that I am a part of. Our team uploads and schedules multiple videos at a time, up to 2 weeks in advance. This script allows us to add a "like" rating without having to indivudally open each video after it goes live.

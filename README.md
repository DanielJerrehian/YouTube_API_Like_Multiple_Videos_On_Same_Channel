# YouTube_API_Like__Multiple_Videos_On_Same_Channel
Python script using the YouTube API to give the "X" most recent videos a 'thumbs up' rating

The intention of this script was to quickly provide a "like" rating across all videos on a YouTube channel that I co-own. Our team uploads and schedules multiple videos at a time, up to 2 weeks in advance, and does not have the time to check the channel every day. This script allows us to add a "like" rating without having to indivudally open each scheduled video after it goes live in batches of 50 videos.
